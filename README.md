# DanceParty-Riivolution

### This repo will help you patch your physical game directly with Riivolution, instead of repatching the ISO and installing it with USBLoader or Wiiflow.

``` To do this, you must follow the instructions given below (Wii and vWii (Wii U)): ```

1. Please first follow the official Dance Party guide with the following link (Do not follow step 4 of this site): [https://danceparty.online/guide](https://danceparty.online/guide)
2. After patching your "main.dol" file, download the latest release of this repo and move the contents to the root of your SD card.
3. Next, on your SD card, move your "main.dol" file into one of the folders provided for this purpose (i.e., either jd2016, jd2017, or jd2018).
4. Then put your SD card back into your Wii / Wii U, start the "Homebrew channel", put your physical game (so the cd) in your Wii / Wii U, and start the "Riivolution" homebrew.
5. Normally, you will come across the patch called "Dance party 201x", and if Riivolution indicates that it is already "Enabled" then you can click on Start.
6. and Congratulations! You have just completed the steps to be able to play Dance Party on your physical version!
